# Optimization and Modernization Consoles
**We'll take a quick look at two other Insights Consoles**

### Optimization Console
From your Console Home, click on the Optimization Console link to navigate to the main screen

From this view, you can start to see a number of optimization opportunities from the headers including Operating System End-of-Life (EoL), Application EoL, Reclamation and Cloud Rightsizing.

Clicking the Operating System EoL dashboard takes you to a custom view highlighting and upcoming or current EoL Operating System instances in your environment

Clicking on the Application EoL dashboard takes you to a similar view, but instead highlighting common applications that are current or approaching EoL status

The Reclamation Dashboard highlights opportunities to reclaim resources that are either not in use or experiencing minimal activity.  Even before a migration starts, we can start identifing improvement and cost saving opportunities within a client's IT Estate.

### Modernization Console
From your Console Home, click on the Modernization Console link to navigate to the main screen

We are in the process of adding more PaaS service options, but this is where you will see PaaS related options for replatforming to a more modern alternative.  In this example, you can see there are web servers that would be great candidates for AWS Elastic Beanstalk, as well as databases that could be replatformed on to AWS RDS.  

When embarking on a Cloud Migration journey, we want to look at opportunities to Modernize your IT Estate and PaaS offerings are a far more appealing option as opposed to a traditional lift-and-shift in to the Cloud.  


#### Well done.
