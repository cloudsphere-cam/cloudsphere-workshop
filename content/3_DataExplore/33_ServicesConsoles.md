# Main Insight Consoles
**In addition to the Explorer UI, CloudSphere has an extensive collection of detailed dashboards and reports that provide valuable insight related to your scanned environment(s)**

### Insight Consoles Overview

Selecting the Insight Console option in the left nav menu will open a new browser tab.

![Console home](/images/consolehome.PNG)

To get started, let's first navigate to the Executive Summary console using the link in the top right of the screen.  

![Exec Summary home](/images/execsummaryhome.PNG)

This console contains a wealth of high level detail related to the environments scanned.  Geographic mapping, as well as summary detail on IT Elements, Application Types and Database vendors are all available in the top row at a glance.

The second row of data contains detail related to the services mapping in the environment, as well as the review status and more.

The third row of data related to the migration recommendations (6 R's) and wave planning details.  

This console is great for providing high level insights in to the migration process as your team is preparing for or executing a migration.  


### Insight Console

Let's go ahead and close this tab and go back to the Insight Console view.  This is a critical view for understanding the success and completeness of your scan jobs.

If there is a need for remediation, such as credential failures, partially discovered servers or IPs that weren't in scope, we can identify and resolve as needed from this screen.  

In the Discovery Remediation summary, there are links to detailed views of each remediation need to make the resolutions easy to identify and take action against.

In the Build Business Context section, you can see application level detail for what has been mapped versus what the system is suggesting or has found but not able to identify with confidence.

In the Review and Enrich Services Data, this is where you can see a detailed view of the services identified and the associated statuses for the review, migration and other attributes.

### Migration Console

Let's move on from here to the Migration Console, by selecting the link at the top of the screen.  

![Migration Console home](/images/migconsolehome.PNG)

From this screen, you can see high level detail related to planning for a cloud migration, including links to an Economic Assessment Dashboard, as well as a Migration planning dashboard.

Below the row of charts, there is a detailed report at infrastructure and service level which can be exported as needed.

Selecting the Migration Exclusion Dashboard will take you to a detailed report of any assets that have been excluded from the migration process.  This ensures that the migration planning dashboards include only the assets that are in scope for the migration and aren't cluttered with extraneous assets.

Selecting the Economic Assessment Dashboard will open a new tab with a wealth of financial data related to the cloud migration. This dashboard can help to understand the TCO and expected savings associated with the cloud migration.  The figures include "like for like" TCO estimates, as well as right-sized estimates, that represent what the reduced cost would be with appropriate resource sizing.  

There are also calculations related to the associated savings when opting for a 1 or 3 year reserved instance committment.  These costs can be toggled by AWS region by toggling the drop down on the left of this report.  

![Economic Assessment](/images/econassess.PNG)

Below the charts and cost estimates, there is a detailed report of the data dipicted above at a line item level as needed, such as the server recommendations.

![Economic Assessment Detail](/images/econassessdetail.PNG)

Closing this tab and clicking on the Migration Planning Dashboard will open a new report with some of the data from the Executive Summmary, with some additions.

![Migration Planning](/images/migplan.PNG)

In the middle of the page, you can move between tabs including Service Details, Service Migration Process and PaaS Options.  You will also see, in this example, that the cost estimates are provided at an aggregate and individual service level.  This helps with business case development and shows the cost savings available on a per service basis. You'll notice the PayRoll and ElkStack examples we reviewed earlier here in specific detail.

![Migration Planning 2](/images/migplan2.PNG)

Each tab contains a unique data set related to the planning and execution of a migration.
