## A little about us... <!-- MODIFY THIS SUBHEADING -->
CloudSphere was founded through a merger of two companies, Hypergrid and iQuate. With legacy roots in cloud asset management and software asset management, an industry-leading cloud governance was created to meet the needs of businesses. 

CloudSphere is an AWS ISV Partner and part of the APN Partner program with competencies in Migration & Modernization and Cloud Operations Software.  CloudSphere can be procured through the AWS Marketplace or via Private Offer.<br>
