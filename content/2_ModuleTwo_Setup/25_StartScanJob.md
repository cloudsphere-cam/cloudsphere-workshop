# Starting your Scan Job <!-- MODIFY THIS HEADING IF NECESSARY -->

Now that you have configured your Scan Job, it's time to scan the environment.

### Executing a Scan Job
Select the Scan Job created in the previous step

Click the large blue Start button in the upper left side of the screen

You can also cancel the Scan Job from this screen at any time.


### Reviewing a Scan Job Status
Once the Scan Job kicks off, you'll see a real-time progress bar indicating the status of the Scan Job

Once the Scan Job is completed, you'll see the progress, completeness and additional details regarding the total number of devices and IPs scanned.  

In the case of a partial failure, you'll be able to review each target IP address with a status of PartialScan or CredentialFailed in order to remediate as necessary.  The Scan info column will provide high level detail related to what info was captured or the nature of the failure.

**REMOVE:** With the exception of _index.md, the module folders and filenames should be changed to better reflect their content, i.e. 1_Planning as the folder and 11_HowToBegin as the first submodule. Changing the "weight" value of the header is ultimately what reflects the order the modules are presented.
