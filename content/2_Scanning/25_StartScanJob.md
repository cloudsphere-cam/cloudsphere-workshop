Once the Scan Job is completed, you'll see the progress, completeness and additional details regarding the total number of devices and IPs scanned.  

In the case of a partial failure, you'll be able to review each target IP address with a status of PartialScan or CredentialFailed in order to remediate as necessary.  The Scan info column will provide high level detail related to what info was captured or the nature of the failure.
