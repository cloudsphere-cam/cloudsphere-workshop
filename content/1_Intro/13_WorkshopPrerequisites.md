**REMOVE:** With the exception of _index.md, the module folders and filenames should be changed to better reflect their content, i.e. 1_Planning as the folder and 11_HowToBegin as the first submodule. Changing the "weight" value of the header is ultimately what reflects the order the modules are presented.
