# Workshop Background

## The Market Challenge 

IT estates are increasingly complex and are typically spread across physical and virtual infrastructure.  CloudSphere gives AWS and it's partners complete IT estate inventories, along with mapping of communications and dependencies.  With these inventories and maps, clients can move to the cloud with confidence, while minimizing risk.

In addition to a user-friendly UI for data exploration, CloudSphere provide a wealth of valuable data via our interactive Insights Consoles.
